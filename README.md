# ZScript Bare Bones
This repository shows a bare bones example of how to use ZScript to make a custom actor, including a map file and the `MAPINFO` file to make the actor available in [Ultimate Doom Builder](https://github.com/UltimateDoomBuilder/UltimateDoomBuilder).

With thanks to Jekyllgrim for their [ZScript Basics](https://github.com/jekyllgrim/ZScript_Basics) guide.
